# IGN-Game-Review-Analysis

This is my first data science project. I wanted to practice exploratory data analysis so I looked for a data set in my interest.
I found one related to video games here:https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/2awdgx/i_made_this_dataset_of_all_of_igns_game_reviews/

I blogged about my findings. You can read through and tell me what you think. You download this set yourself and tell me what you find! Though in advance I'll tell you this data set has not dates and is a few years old so you'll have to make do.

I used dplyr, ggplot2, and XLConnect
